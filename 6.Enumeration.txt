1.Enumeration
==============
	Legacy Interface (introduced in JDK 1.0)
	Used to iterate over legacy collections like Vector and Hashtable

Methods:
--------
	hasMoreElements()
	nextElement()

Limitations
-----------
	Read-only traversal (can't remove elements)
	Forward only traversal

2.Iterator
===========
	-Introduced in Java 1.2 as part of the Java Collections Framework
	-Can be used with most collections

Methods:
--------
	hasNext()
	next()
	remove()

	Can remove elements during iteration
	Forward only traversal

3. ListIterator
=================
	Subinterface of Iterator
	Only for List implementations (like ArrayList, LinkedList)
	Bidirectional traversal (forward and backward)

Methods:
--------
	hasNext()
	next()	
	hasPrevious()
	previous()
	remove()

	Can iterate forward and backward
	Can modify list (remove)	
	Allows fine control over iteration
